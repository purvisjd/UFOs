# UFO Sighting Analysis:  Is the truth out there?

## Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this project was to provide a Javascript based method for reviewing a data file of potential UFO sighting information.  The information was organized into a table that was created using a combination of HTML formatting and Javascript programming for functionality.  Users of this table can view all of the information provided in a visually pleasing format or they can filter the information based on a combination of the following criteria:  date of sighting, city of sighting, state of sighting, country of sighting, or shape of object sighted.
